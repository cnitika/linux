ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step: How to Change the Icon of Any Program
Let's change the icon of Gedit (text editor) as an example.

âœ… 1. Find the Appâ€™s .desktop File
.desktop files define how the app appears in your menu
>>sudo nano /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop

ðŸ’¡ You can also copy it to your user directory to make changes only for your account:
>>cp /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
nano ~/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop

âœ… 2. Edit the Icon Path
Look for the line:
>>Icon=gedit

*Change it to:
 >>Icon=/home/yourusername/Pictures/custom_gedit_icon.png
âœ… Make sure the path points to a .png or .svg file, ideally 256x256 or scalable.

âœ… 3. Refresh the Icon Cache
 >>sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
Or simply log out and log back in if youâ€™re lazy ðŸ˜„

âœ… 4. See the Magic
Open your app drawer or search for the app.

The new icon should appear!

If not, try restarting your session or checking file permissions.
